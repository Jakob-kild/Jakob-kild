## About me
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at DTU, where I also completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering. My expertise spans several programming languages, though Iâ€™m particularly skilled in Java and Python. Some of my key projects include:

- **Evolutionary Algorithms Bachelor Project** â€“ My bachelorâ€™s thesis focused on evolutionary algorithms, where I collaborated with designing a framework for visualizing nature-inspired optimization metaheuristics, such as Simulated Annealing & Ant Colony Optimization.
- **Dynatest** â€“ A collaboration with the company Dynatest to develop a tool that enhances the visualization of road network damage.
