## About me
I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at DTU, where I also completed my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. My expertise spans several programming languages, though I’m particularly skilled in Java and Python. Some of my key projects include:

- **Evolutionary Algorithms Bachelor Project** – My bachelor’s thesis focused on evolutionary algorithms, where I collaborated on designing a framework for visualizing nature-inspired optimization metaheuristics, such as Simulated Annealing & Ant Colony Optimization.
- **Dynatest** – A collaboration with the company Dynatest to develop a tool that enhances the visualization of road network damage.
